This is a modified recording of a talk I did at Electronic Arts in April of 2008. The original ran double time, but contained EA proprietary material that I removed.

None of the ideas in this talk are mine. This talk is based on material from Lawrence Lessig (presentation style and font), Guy Kawasaki, Barry Schwartz (the Paradox of Choice), Jeff Atwood (microwaves), Jeff Hawkins, Jason Cooper, and Tipper (music).
