At the end of 2007, Roderick lived with me for three months, visiting from Holland, doing an internship on the UBC campus. He had not seen his girlfriend for two months, so we flew her over as a surprise.

While Roderick was on the bus coming home from work, we called him and said that UPS had deliver a large box. He has no idea what's in it.

The video starts with some photos from a visit that Roderick and Marleen made to Vancouver some years earlier. Twenty seconds in, Roderick is up for a shock.

As for the music, it's intentionally sappy. Tear up...
