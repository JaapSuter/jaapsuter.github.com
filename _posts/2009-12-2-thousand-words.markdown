On the other hand, Michael's argument about drag racing is compelling too. Just because I can do something unbeautifully on my current machine doesn't mean that if I were clever enough I could do the same on the 8086 I first owned. 

### Jaap

The tool used to move from powerful back to less-powerful is somewhat different in either case though. In drag racing, you're hoping that better oil, improved rocket fuel, polishing the hub-cab, and changing the aerodynamics of the body - will make you go faster. In computing, you're hoping that a mathematical insight will make you go faster.  

They're a theoretical similarity; perhaps some incredible new insight into aerodynamics will give a lawnmower a new body and make it go FTL. 

That said, I think mathematical insights have a track-record of unsurpassed retro-applicable power.

Like bubblesorting for a century, and then suddenly coming up with quicksort. 

### Jason
I've seen a lot about people that's simple enough to make me think you might be right.

Though the bits that aren't make me wonder. 

### Jaap
...make you wonder if there's something "different", or something that's "a matter of time"?

Regarding mathematics's powerful ability to retrospectively simplify - without it, the difference in growth rates over spaces of increasing dimension would have long been a cause for despair.

Consider the body of "human wisdom/knowledge", our collective map or manual for reality. Intuitively, the map is a *N* dimensional subspace embedded in our universe, which is *M >= N* dimensions. 

Some *6,534,658* dimensional blob that captures the fully recursive expansion of human beliefs that match reality. The space exists within a *42,378,943,278,942,378,748,239* dimensional space that represents the entire universe of true beliefs that intelligent beings can have about reality.

Perhaps one day both spaces will collapse into a single *Awesomely Cool Grand Theory Of Everything That Is Awesome And Cool*, but until such an "Omega-day" (now that'll be a national holiday I'm sure) we're mostly expanding our belief space.

In other words, our map of reality has many axis along which our wisdom can grow.

### Jason
Nice.

Dimensionality reduction -- on the dataset of "all data about the universe". 

### Jaap

For the sake of visualization, consider the blob a plain old fashioned 3D sphere that demarks the limits of human knowledge.

Two BC it was small... Then it grew steadily until 1100 AD, hovered in place a little during the dark ages... and the last two centuries it has grown enormously.... 

But remember I'm talking about the collective sphere. We also have our individual spheres. 

When we're born, we're pretty much at zero size. We have a tiny built-in evolutionary grasp of reality - but that's it. From then on, it's up to us to grow the sphere.

And for those who dare, to extend parts of the personal sphere to the outer rim of the collective sphere. That's where you can push on the surface and expand it.

If you're not bored yet, then you'll be happy to hear I can make my point at long last... 
### Jason

Actually, I'm trying to reconcile your picture with mine. 
### Jaap

Namely, that traveling is largely a one dimensional effort 

That is to say, from one Planck-moment to the other, you're only going in one direction. 

### Jason
Right. 

### Jaap
Hopefully, you can trace out 2D areas, sweep out 3D volumes, and have progress along one axes benefit higher dimensions... 

### Jason

Yeah, that's the reconciliation there. 

### Jaap

Now because our lives are finite (for the time being anyway), speed of light is a killjoy, and we have to eat and sleep, there's an upper bound on the *volume* one can sweep out.

That is, until you **leverage mathematical retrospect and abstract**. 

### Jason
I saw on reddit the other day that a Royal Society had published a bunch of old papers on the net. 

People get really excited about that, but if you want to see the fruits of the kind of simplification you're talking about, then a comparison of, say, Schrodinger's early papers on quantum mechanics and a recent textbook will do the trick. 

(Not that it's not still fun to read the old papers) 

### Jaap

The notion of "traveling" from the moment your born towards the outer surface of the collective sphere (and beyond for some).... I really enjoy that visualization

First, because it so nicely captures the time and distance it takes (standing on the shoulders of giants past) until you reach the edge - which is where you can push on the wall and go beyond it...  

Second, because growth-rates increase non-linearly with dimension, we instantly recognize that we _must_ always find ways to improve our travel speed.
### Jason

Yeah. Also, the fact that we now spend 20 years in formal schooling to even come close to the edge is helpful. And it helps, for that, that we're living longer. 

### Jaap

Totally hear you on the Schrodinger papers... People internalizing highschool math as a bag-of-tricks notwithstanding, some subset of today's 20-year-olds do internalize math as a language to describe reality to a point beyond Newton's at age 40.
### Jason

Sure. Language is power. 

Frankly, I see teaching Physics as fundamentally a problem of teaching language. I mean, if you really knew what is meant by acceleration, wouldn't it be immediately obvious that *v = v_0 + at* for constant acceleration? 
### Jaap

It would be, though I wonder if the obviousness doesn't fall from a circular kind of reasoning (through your implicit "really know what is meant by acceleration").

I do agree that language is a root issue... 

Not surprising, considering that language is the most effective mechanism for communicating new ideas -- if not the only one.

Sure, a picture is worth a 1000 words - but which 1000? I think most people don't realize how much information theoretic content fits in 1000 words... 
### Jason

I think that how much fits in 1000 words depends on which ones you already know, for one thing. :) 

Outside of a strictly academic sense of content.
### Jaap

Jup, and that's the source of most issues. 

**The conflict between communicating more efficiently because one can make assumptions as to what the receiving end already knows - and communicating less efficiently because we make the wrong assumptions.**

### Jason

Certainly. Ongoing assessment is a gigantic part of teaching.

### Jaap

We had that conversation about paths of reasoning right? *A->B->C->...->Z*, and finding the longest common sub path? 

### Jason
Yeah.

### Jaap
For comedy only, just pulling some numbers from the internet...

The average word length in a typical English text is 5.1 letters.

The Shannon measure of entropy in the English language is 1.1 bits per letter... (conjectured/estimated maximum compression level) 
Not sure if the 5.10 number includes spaces, but let's assume and ignore. Calculate *(5.1 \* 1000 \* 1.1) / 8* and we might say that **1000 words contain 700 bytes of information**. 
### Jason

Huh -- really? That's a lot lower than I'd expected. 

Ah, you know what, no it's not... :P 

### Jaap
I challenge you to give me a picture of 700 bytes or less that has a masturbation worthy quantity of erotic content... 
### Jason
Really? 
### Jaap
Whereas a thousand words... that's an entire box of kleenex..       ;-) hah!
### Jason
Hm, yeah, 700 bytes will be challenging. 
### Jaap
Shannon's estimate (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)) of 1.1 (that website actually says 1.5) bits per letter feels low to me. I suspect it's caused by the multiplicative effect of the knowledge one brings to the table. 

Maybe a word like "democracy" is only 9.9 bits, but the moment I read it; I prime a huge amount of associative data in my brain... 
### Jason

Ooh -- I know I can get this down to 700 bytes. I've got 2075...  :-)

### Jaap

So it feels like "democracy" contains way more (close to how many bytes there'd be in a digital copy of a book on democracy). 
### Jason

It does to you. 

But that's all contextual. That's cheating.

### Jaap

Conversely, the locality of images is why it suffers a problem that is almost opposite of the association-trigger we get from words. An image is a continuous representation of a local subspace. This is obvious for a painted portrait, but compressed digital imagery doesn't have much purpose until we expand it again - rendering the continuous locality it represented.

I agree, it's cheating; which is why I think the 1.1 bits number isn't as low as one might expect at first... 

I mean, ultimately a 700 byte text file contains just as much information as a 700 byte image.

How much?

Easy, 700 bytes...

But text can leverage priors, whereas images suffer from neighbouring pixels. Leave too much space between each pixel, and the image loses value rapidly.

Of course, leave too much space between words, and the text becomes useless... 

### Jason

Hm. On the other hand, I'd accept that something like wavelet compression (and to a lesser extent, jpeg compression, I think) is a pretty meaningful representation of how we deal with images.

Which is kind of why I feel like a JPEG representation is a fair enough assessment of the actual content. It doesn't suffer as badly from those neighboring pixels. 

### Jaap

Acknowledging your wavelet comment...  
### Jason

I assume you're familiar with Isomap? 

I ask because it was among the first things I thought of when you mentioned the idea of knowledge as a subspace way up there. 
### Jaap

I am not... searching. 

### Jason

Plus, it's kind of my hammer-de-jour. 

### Jaap

Hey, nice! 

Bookmarked (... I'm in the middle of something currently that requires some focus, sorry)...

### Jason

No worries. 

Sending an article back your way for when you've got a minute or two. 

It's an insane algorithm. 

### Jaap

Insane, how? 

### Jason

Given a metric on the m-dimensional whole space, Isomap uses what is essentially a sort of SVD to develop an n-dimensional representation that "captures the essentials". 

What's insane is that in the paper I'm sending, their examples are 64x64 black and white images, using the obvious 4096-dimensional vector representation to give a metric, and the thing picks out (for example) a dimension in which a face in the image turns from right to left.

Anyway, as a metaphor, it makes me think that the problem of learning more about the world breaks into two parts. Easier is an extension in one or more dimensions (expanding spheres). Harder is an expansion into another dimension. 

The fun bit about Isomap is that if you ask it for a 2-dimensional representation, it'll feed back what (by the metric you give) are the 2 most important degrees of freedom. You ask for 3, it'll give you the exact same 2, plus another.

Similarly, I think that when we explore the world, there are dimensions that are required for survival, and there are dimensions that are required for further understanding. 

We kind of add as we go. 

### Jaap

Hey, thanks for observing the difference between extending along an existing dimension and discovering a new dimension...

Leveraging a previously unknown or misunderstood dimension is a better analogy than my portal reference to explain short-cuts.

### Jason

I think the additional dimensions can be very profitable to. In as much as volume is a good representation of how much one understands, finding new dimensions offers exponential growth, where extending in existing dimensions is polynomial at best.

### Jaap

Hah, that's leveraging the non-linearity of higher-dimenional growth-rates to your advantage, instead of it being a source of despair and diminishing returns...

Of course, depending on how exactly one defines or measures dimensions, actually finding a new one is anywhere from a daily occurence to something that's only been done by a few well known historical figures (Plato, Newton, Einstein, etc. fill in the blanks, resolution-dependent)
### Jason

Right. I think that we discover dimensions which are new to us quite frequently (annually, say), or can at any rate. New to humanity... I imagine that's a bigger deal.

Particularly because I guess there's no guarantee that we're finding them from highest eigenvalue to lowest.

### Jaap

I sense an opportunity for me to benefit from your math expertise. Tell me more about these **igon**-values...   ;-)
