### Size

The average word length in English is about five letters. The upper-bound Shannon's gave for entropy of the English language is 1.3 bits per character.

So a thousand words contain roughly 1000 \* 5 \* 1.3 / 8 = 813 bytes.

Picture are continuous subsets of a local domain, which means every pixel (or photon) carries information from its neighbours. This overhead makes imagery less brittle than words, but also less powerful.
