### Michael
I'm having a really hard time getting work done in Cranbrook. I think a familiar
environment may be important...     :P

### Jaap
Mweh, by that token I should be hyper productive this very second.

### Michael
Well, not to say the converse is true.

### Jaap
Right, you list familiarity as a necessary, not a sufficient requirement.

### Michael
Nice, I think you've said it better than I did.

In fact, this is not a "converse" thing at all. And in any case, the only sensible thing
would be an implication that the converse was false.

Gah.

Ah, the inverse, perhaps.

### Jaap
Tricky, there's a lot in your two initial sentences that can be either reverted
(converted) or inverted - without landing at the premise I posed.

Alas, details.

What are you trying to get done then -- is it related to work?

And you're in Cranbrook again? I seem to recall you were there recently.

### Michael
Elisa's dad died earlier this week. The funeral's on Tuesday.

So we're hanging out until then. Came down just before to see him.

Previously, he'd taken ill, so we came down to see him.

### Jaap
Ah, that sucks. My condolences, to Elisa as well.

Is that the first of one of your and Elisa's parents to pass away?

### Michael
Yep. Probably the hardest, too.

### Jaap
Really sorry mate...

### Michael
Elisa was really attached to her dad.

Not that I'm not attached to my parents, but I *think* I take a slightly different
view on their deaths. I suppose we'll see, eventually.

### Jaap
I usually wouldn't bring this up in such a context \[1\], but I think you can handle
this; what are your thoughts on the possibility that Elisa's dad will have just
missed the boat in terms of longevity?

\[1\]: Meaning that I'm well aware that a funeral is not the right moment to approach family and friends
to say: "*Boy, wish he had signed up for cryonics now, eh?*"

### Michael
Well, I was thinking about that quite a lot. Two months ago, he was A-okay, and
then in the last 3 weeks or so, he just got taken down by an incredibly aggressive
lymphoma.

Was quite interesting to watch.

### Jaap
Damn... how old?

### Michael
70.

So, not super young, but not that old, either.

But it made me think, at some point in the future (who knows how long), this would
be a non-issue.

It's his freakin' body that died.

And that's not really the part Elisa cared for.

### Jaap
Dude, you so totally nailed it. No Alzheimer's here, that guy had a fully functional
brain.

### Michael
It really underscored for me, I think, the extent to which we lose information when
someone dies like that.

It's exactly like nobody made a backup, and then the machine was shut down. What
can you do?

Well, you can make backups, for one.

### Jaap
I'll be curious if this event will change the strategy for you or Elisa, a little
ways down, once the immediacy of emotional and practical (e.g., funeral,
etc.) consequences has worn off a little.

### Michael
An interesting question. For me, it doesn't quite reach the threshold of changing
things (emotional/practical matters being more or less complete for me).

Trying to think why that is.

### Jaap
Yeah, I've been trying to figure out the disconnect between my convincement that
cryonics makes sense, and my paralysis towards actually signing up.

Probably a genetic handicap towards far-mode thinking, in favor of near-mode thinking.

### Michael

Ooh... I saw something you will be interested in: [St. Petersburg Paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_paradox)

Thought of you when I read this, and here's why...

It's one of these "paradoxes" that isn't really a paradox at all, just a bit of
a hiccup. But it's an interesting hiccup.

It's a game with infinite expected payoff, but which almost nobody would play.

Well, that is, nobody would play it at a high price, despite the infinite expected
payoff.

### Jaap
I'm familiar with the St. Petersburg paradox, yes.

### Michael
Right. So...

There are a couple of theories I've read on how it is resolved, and I'm not really
keen on either.

One is marginal utility.

Bah.

### Jaap
Please continue, I like where you are going.

### Michael
The other is risk-aversion. But they seem to frame it oddly...

Looking for the place where I saw that one explained, but having a hard time finding
it. I really wasn't very happy with the explanation.

In fact...

A lot of the time I'm not really happy with this kind of discussion, because it
seems like a large number of the rebuttals are along the lines of, "Yeah, but a
casino could never make an infinite payout," which seems to be missing the point.

Here's what I'm thinking...

Suppose buy-in was a million dollars.

### Jaap
Risk-aversion should account for the risk of bottoming out your available
money.

### Michael
Expected payout is infinite, so we're still good. But, would you put a million on
the line for a very small (albeit profitable) chance to win more?

### Jaap

I think marginal utility is a ancestral genetic trait, related to near/far-mode
thinking.

### Michael
Ah, you know, risk aversion might be closer to what I think, then.

It may have been poorly explained where I read it. To me, the marginal utility is not an issue.

It's not that I wouldn't play because the payoffs are a small percentage of the
accumulated winnings.

It's simply that if I have a million dollars in my pocket, I can think of better
ways to use it than to gamble it on winning 10 million.

### Jaap
I wouldn't play because the time/expected-pay-off ratio is poor. If I spent that
time working, I'll make more money.

### Michael
Sure.

Coming around to the original point...

With regard to cryonics, I think the problem for me is that, although the expected
payout is very high (arguably infinite), I stop short for similar reasons.

The thing is, I'm really enjoying my life right now, and in order to invest in cryonics,
I would need to take something away from that.

### Jaap
But I think that's mostly because of a genetic blindspot towards putting value on
life extension.

### Michael
I don't think so. I put huge value on it.

It is, to me, an infinite payout.

But it's an infinite payout *in the future* which I have to pay into now.

### Jaap
Right, you don't "feel" it.

Now consider, if you were told that you were going to die tomorrow.

But you could pay some amount of money N to live another M days...

What would N and M be...?

Note that your price affects how much money you'll have left the remainder of your life, which makes the
question distinct from the gut-reaction that you'd pay all the money you'd own because it's worthless after
death anyway.

### Michael
Hmm... an interesting question.

Another M days after when? 

(I think this question itself may be more telling than the answer to it.)

### Jaap
After today (I know that isn't the case for cryonics).

### Michael
So, I'm going to die for sure tomorrow unless I shell out some cash.

### Jaap
The short-circuit argument to that is along the: "I don't negotiate with terrorists,"
because they're imaginging they're being mugged in a dark alley and have to pay
100 bucks...

But that's not what I mean. Zoom out far enough and our bodies (/evolution) becomes
the terrorist.

### Michael
Are we bartering, or is the rate fixed?

If we're bartering, then I'll give you $100 a day.

If the rate is fixed, then I'll give you my entire accumulated wealth divided by
that rate.

Whoops.

That is, I'll give you my entire accumulated wealth - at that rate.

If I knew I was gong to die tomorrow if I didn't spend the money, then I think it
would be pointless to hang onto the cash, which won't do me any good when I'm wormfood.

### Jaap
So **if** it was proven that Cryonics works, you'd pay $100 a day for its effects?

Note the oddity about Cryonics being proven to work. The minute it works, you won't need it
anymore (presumably because regeneration is available the instant your body shuts down - the
use of cryonics for boredom induced time travel notwithstanding). Interesting how an
experiments success instantly renders it obsolete - it's usually the other way around.

### Michael
$100 is my starting price, not my limit.

But, it's also contingent on my knowing that, otherwise, I'll die tomorrow.

If I don't know when I'm going to die, then for now, I'm inclined to play the odds.

### Jaap
Yeah, the mugging argument doesn't tranlate entirely. But it forces one to momentarily
think and realize: "*Wait a second, I don't want to die, I'd pay a shitload of money
(everything I have, because when I'm dead, it's not worth anything) to live another
day.*"

Not everybody gets to that realization....

### Michael
Right... \:-)

### Jaap
So the odds you're playing are that life-extension will come while you are still
alive...

### Michael
More or less. I see a probability of my surviving N days.

### Jaap
Those are non-unrealistic odds, and they bring me to my current standing opinion
on the future - my distilled view on the singularity:

 * My life is not likely to end from old age.

### Michael
Indeed. More or less my problem, I think.

Not that I think there's a high chance I will die, e.g., BASE jumping, but were
it to happen, cryonics would be pointless.

### Jaap
The options are:

 1. Death from accident.
 2. Death from early onset disease.
 3. Death from (majority of) species extinction.
 4. Transformation past human biology.
 
And the dreaded...
 
 5. It takes longer than we like to believe, causing death from old age (through late onset disease most likely).
 
Question is; is the last option least likely on a rational basis, or because we might dread it?

### Michael
I certainly feel like the most likely way for me to die in the short term is major
trauma (car accident, BASE jump, shot in the head by a rogue AI, whatever).

In the very long term, old age becomes an issue.

But that gives me lots of time to prepare.

It's like the argument that I can maintain high-risk investments while I'm young,
because convergence of my invested sum is not critical.

It's okay if it goes up/down 50%.

When I get closer to retirement, that becomes an issue.

So, my investment strategy changes.

### Jaap
Wow...

That may go for money, but not for life.

### Michael
Why not?

### Jaap
Or did I misinterpret?

### Michael
Well, not that high-risk is the way to go for life.

But that strategy changes depending on the perceived risks.

### Jaap
Because if you have enough life, you can recover from poverty. But if you're out
of life, you can't recover.

### Michael
In the case of life, it's the idea that I am unlikely to die of old age in the next
10 years.

Or, for that matter, from lymphoma.

### Jaap
That's why playing a long enough St. Petersburg isn't appealing to people, because
they can bottom out and go bankrupt (financial equivalent of dying, you can't recover
(within the game)).

Mmmmm, let me try a summary

The statement: "*...because I'm young, I can BASE jump, because I haven't invested
a whole lot yet.*" That's true from an outside view (similar to how a gambler has
an outside view onto his wallet with money)....

### Michael
Ah, not quite what I meant. (Though perhaps you are not referring to my statements.)

### Jaap
You mean, "*...because I'm young, the kind of death where cryonics may help is not
likely enough compared to the other future outcomes (e.g., we invent longevity,
AI's whipe us out, I die from BASE) that it makes it worth the money*".

### Michael
Or the cognitive load, really.

### Jaap
And that I'm inclined to agree with... Cryonics itself is already a scientific gamble,
and you're adding a personal gamble on top, that you'll reach death in such a way
that it'll be amenable to succesful cryonics.

And you're right, the cognitive load is a pain. Filling out forms, signing paper work,
talking to friends/family, faxing shit.

Sadly, I'm not even being sarcastic...

### Michael
I figured not...   :-)

### Jaap
But alas, I totally get your point, and I agree.

My "wow" was to my initial (mistaken) interpretation that you translated a gambling
analogy to life. Utility is cool and all, but I am not the dollar bill in my wallet.
And corollary; I'm glad my dollar bill isn't conscious.

### Michael
Agreed 100%.

### Jaap
Did you get an email? Wondering if you have any thoughts on the "*...want to be part of
the rapture?*" argument.

### Michael
Are you referring to the transformational event?

### Jaap
Quoting the email...

"*Namely, that if my life has to end anyway, I'd rather that happens as part of a
big interesting transformational (if not catastrophic) event, than it happening
as just another mundane death like the majority of deaths that have occurred before
mine.*"

### Michael
Roger.

### Jaap
It seems more fun to die when the world ends (i.e., the end station for the species),
than somewhere along the middle...

### Michael
Hmmm...

### Michael
A couple of thoughts come to mind.

### Jaap
Let's say I had a button I could push to make the singularity happen, and my doctor says
I have only three months to live.

What would I do?

I think it'd be tempting to push that button. Not even because it may save my life, but to fill
the last three months with excitement (a temptation most likely suffering from serious Hollywood war-drama romanticism.)

### Michael

First, I'm not completely sure I think it would be more interesting to die in a revolution
than of old age. I may think it would be more interesting to *live* through a revolution.
Although, even there, at the moment I'm inclined to say I'd rather have a choice
of how I spend my time, as opposed to being forced to take up arms, etc.

Secondly, I wonder what effect this perception has on my interest in, e.g., cryonics.

### Jaap
Good point - increase the viability of cryonics, and I'd be more inclined to let it sit.

The last thing you want to do before getting frozen is piss off a lot of people.

I think the button's temptation boils down to curiousity.

You can sort of see it as a bandwidth issue. The more things happen in my local universe before I
die, the more I can cram through my own IO ports, and the closer I get to the intellectual
finish line.

We're talking about moving a millimeter forward on a lightyear long scale, but I
got this thing called curiousity, and it's mighty powerful.

### Michael

Keep your hands off that button Jaap.

### Jaap

Interesting -- cryonics helps preserve the world. The longer you live, the higher your stake in realizing high quality futures.
