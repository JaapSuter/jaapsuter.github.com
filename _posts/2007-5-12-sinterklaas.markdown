Rather than having Santa Claus show up for Christmas, in Holland the tradition
involves a similar looking guy called _Sinterklaas_ who, on December
5th, also goes from house to house to deliver presents.

Several years in a row I would invite Sinterklaas to Vancouver a few weeks earlier
to bring some gifts for my friends. In 2007, the evening got inspired by <a href="http://xkcd.com/150/">this XKCD comic</a>...

I first ordered 500 plain balls, as a test. Satisfied, this lead to an invitation video...

{% assign id = '1879155' %}
{% assign width = '640' %}
{% assign height = '427' %}
{% assign ratio = '3x2' %}
{% include embed-vimeo.html %}

I then ordered 4000 more colored balls, resulting in a bedroom sized ballpit for the actual event.

{% assign id = '26460398' %}
{% assign width = '640' %}
{% assign height = '360' %}
{% assign ratio = '16x9' %}
{% include embed-vimeo.html %}

My friends and I enjoyed the ballpit for about two months, after which the entire collection of balls was donated to a
local home for children with developmental disabilities.
