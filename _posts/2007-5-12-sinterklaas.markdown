Rather than having Santa Claus show up around Christmas, in the Netherlands the tradition
involves a similar looking guy called _Sinterklaas_ who, on December
5th, also goes from house to house to deliver presents.

For several years I would invite Sinterklaas to come visit Vancouver a few weeks earlier
to bring some gifts for my friends. In 2007, inspiration came from <a href="http://xkcd.com/150/">this XKCD comic</a>...

I first ordered 500 plain balls, as a test. Satisfied, this lead to the invitation video above.

I then ordered 4000 more colored balls, resulting in a bedroom sized ballpit for the actual event. I really ought to upload
some photos...

My friends and I enjoyed the ballpit for another two months, after which the entire collection of balls was donated to a
local home for children with developmental disabilities.
