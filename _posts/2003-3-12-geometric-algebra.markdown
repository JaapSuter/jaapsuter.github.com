Adopted with great enthusiasm in physics, geometric algebra slowly emerges
in computational science. Its elegance and ease of use is unparalleled. By
introducing two simple concepts, the multivector and its geometric product,
we obtain an algebra that allows subspace arithmetic. It turns out that being
able to "calculate" with subspaces is extremely powerful, and solves many of the
hacks required by traditional methods. This paper provides an introduction to
geometric algebra. The intention is to give the reader an understanding of the
basic concepts, so advanced material becomes more accessible.
