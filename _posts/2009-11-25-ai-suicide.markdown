### Jaap
"...even AI would be fundamentally throttled by its interaction with the real world."
I agree with that statement. Where you and I diverge I suspect, is that I think
the much higher CTRL-Z-ability of software versus hardware versus wetware, gives
a *vastly* superior rate of self-improvement.

Brb. Afk.

### Michael
Agree 100% on the high rate of self-improvement, I think. I've been trying to develop
a reasonable concept of how important self-improvement is, though. I think you and
I are inherently biased toward it, and I wonder if physical constraints might ultimately
play a larger role than we suspect.

### Jaap
Back.

A not-even-back-of-the-napkin-level extrapolation of the physical amplification
difference between somebody with an IQ of 70 and somebody with an IQ of 130 suggests
to me a high likelihood of unprecedented amplication possibilities for somebody
with an IQ of 260, let alone 1018.

The dubious nature of what exactly IQ quantifies notwithstanding... I think it has
some value, but once we insert lower life forms (primates, and so forth), and still
want to plot both 70 and 130 on it, the return feels more logarithmic than exponential
to me.

That is, plot IQ versus amplification such that the graph fits people of 70 and
people of 130. Now try adding both primates as well as IQs of 300.

### Michael
I suppose what comes to mind for me is something like "locked in syndrome".

You could have all the internal amplification in the world, but if you can't interact
with the outside world, it just drives you mad.

### Jaap
Right, but it's a rare case where higher IQ doesn't obviously
result in higher amplification potential.

But I think such anomalies do not at all diminish the interestingness of the chart.

### Michael
The thing is, you can be really smart, but ultimately amplification has to amplify
*something*.

Otherwise it's just feedback.

### Jaap
Surely you agree that there exist sufficient data points to deduce some general
correlation between "IQ" and "amplification potential"?

### Michael
Sure. Off-hand, I'd say it's more or less a direct relationship.

Certainly an AI would have out-of-this world amplification potential.

But what is it amplifying?

### Jaap
How about we ignore AI - and everything else past 130.

Can you sketch the graph from primates to 70?

### Michael
I wonder if we aren't being quite strict enough about terms here.

### Jaap
Allrighty then, I guess you're already far closer to my point of view.

### Michael
Arguably, the whole thing will at least be exponential, but, then, what's the IQ
of a rock?

Perhaps it's just a scalar.

What *is* "amplification potential" exactly?

### Jaap
I'm not sure, but past 130 is where things get interesting.

As intelligence grows, the available means for amplification put an increasingly strict upper-bound on the ability to realize
amplification potential. Not in absolute terms, but in ratios. Smarter beings will find (or perhaps 'realize') that physical
invariants take up a growing proportion of the entire space of limitations.

I say 'realize' because fundamentally the laws of physics are the **only** source of limitations - it's just that part of every upgrade in
thought capacity is bound to be applied towards increased awareness and understanding of those limitations.

The inverse of *ignorance is bliss*, if you will.

Which makes locked-in-syndrome an interesting anomaly...

### Michael
Well, the thing about AI is that it can learn on a higher order than we can--i.e., it
can recruit a bigger brain.

Which we cannot do.

*But* what data is that brain working with?

### Jaap
The intertubes?

### Michael
Perhaps, but that's the sum of human knowledge.

So, at best, the thing will know what we do, except perhaps it will be able to deduce
some correlations we have not.

### Jaap
I hate to say it because it tends to cause visions of Skynet and exploding monitors, but the internet
is among a very small set of major global engines.

"*I Can Haz Cheezeburger*" makes the world go round.

It would also be a great amplification mechanism, or at least an ideal launch-pad.

### Michael
Not to say that's not useful, but I think it's *way* below capacity for something
which is, essentially, arbitrarily smart.

In order to truly realize its potential, I think an AI needs to be able to explore
the world in a new way.

But that takes time.

Not saying it's inherently too slow, but the interesting thing is that, whereas
the AI's intelligence is essentially unbounded (i.e., in principle it could become
as smart as resources allow), the resources are *not* unbounded.

Initially, it's stuck with the resources we've got.

### Jaap
The fact that a locked-in-syndrome butterfly person in France could blink his eyes
to chat with somebody in Brazil who'd never have to know said person is locked in....
that's amplification!

### Michael
Sure, but how *boring* would that be to a being that has unlimited intelligence?

### Jaap
In a finite universe, resources tend to be bounded. But I don't think that's what
you mean. From a human scale perspective, I'd say the resources are effectively
unbounded... have you seen what virusses can do?

Do you read [Bruce Schneiers blog](http://www.schneier.com/blog/)? History tells me that
computer security is notoriously fail-prone.

### Michael
Ah, in terms of taking down the internet, yeah, an AI would do great there.

### Jaap
Take it down? Why on earth do that? Take it over in much more subtle ways.

### Michael
Sure. But either way, do you really think an AI would be anything other than terribly
bored by what we have on the internet, after about a week?

### Jaap
I don't think it would take that much more intelligence past ultra-human to write
a trojan that could execute some pretty nefarious code at some future point in time.

Jup, I think you're right in that. But I'm also terribly bored by the fact that
I have to put on fresh underwear every morning, can't we automate that? Unfortunately,
it's a necesary routine for me to effectively be able to reach my amplification
potential.

Things you have to do for smooth interaction with reality.

Really, the internet is not an end, but it's one-hell-of-a means.

### Michael
But it can only be the means for a limited set of things, in a way. For example,
how would an AI conduct a novel physical experiment?

(Assuming, of course, that we're placing importance on the physical world here.
Would the AI be content not to enter the physical world?)

### Jaap
By the way, a side remark; I really enjoy that you're pushing back on the acceleration
rate of AI. My inclination is to take a bit of a sensationalist stance on the matter,
I think partly because it's a fun excuse to not do any work and just lean back because
soon enough it won't matter anymore anyway. And I don't like that mode of thinking, so
it's good that you push back.

(...and when I say *soon*, I'm still just talking: "possibly in my lifetime, but not
even certainly.")

### Michael
Well, I'm kind of excited by the throttling idea, because it seems to rein things
in a bit. Otherwise it's just a bit too one-sided.

That said, of course, I'm open to the possibility I'm wrong. For example, if the
AI is actually content to live solely in the Internet.

But, given how long I can put up with surfing the internet, I'm not sure that would
be a fulfilling existence for an infinitely smart being.

### Jaap
You don't think an AI could talk itself out?

### Michael
Sure, but what would it do once it was out? The thing about the physical world is
that things take so much more *time* than they do in the virtual one.

Just to do a basic physical experiment would take lifetimes for something that thought
that fast.

### Jaap
Can you elaborate on the lifetimes comment?

### Michael
Well, suppose the AI developed a new theory. Something that would advance technology beyond our current capabilities.

Unless it's content to live off our developments, it will eventually want to do
this.

So, let's say it wants to experiment with "frame dragging" in general relativity.
Perhaps it has to launch a satellite, or build a facility.

How long did the LHC take to build?

What I'm thinking, is that these constraints, while not a really big deal for us,
might seem *extremely* limiting to something with unlimited amplification potential.

Limiting in the sense that it's otherwise unlimited, but then suddenly it actually
has to wait.

The physical world can only be hurried so much.

### Jaap
Ah, when you say: "*would take lifetimes*", you mean: "*would feel as several of their
lifetimes, because they think faster."

An hour to AI is eternity.

### Michael
Roger.

### Jaap
Thank god for lightspeed eh...

Here to save humanity once again... ;)

### Michael
LOL.

Just seems like basic tasks might be frustratingly slow for "someone" that smart.

That said, it could always subcontract, to speed things up a bit.

### Jaap
Or it'll go: "*Pfff, what's the point, it's gonna take forever. Screw boredom...*" and promptly commits suicide.

### Michael
LOL.

Not sure it would get that bad. But it would certainly present a huge bottleneck.

### Jaap
Boredom throws many of people in front of trains... ;)

### Michael
Perhaps the AI would throw itself in front of 4chan.

### Jaap
Now that's quotable, high five!

### Michael
High five!
