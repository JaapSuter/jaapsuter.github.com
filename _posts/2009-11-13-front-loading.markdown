Hey, have we talked about front-loading sentences before?

<div markdown="1" class="quote">
Hmm, the term seems familiar.

</div>
Where in talking with a person, you know said person is inclined to interrupt
you the moment they discover a flaw in your reasoning, and you thus frontload
all necessary constraints in your sentences. You can't delay constraints, because
you'll already be interrupted - put into a state where: "*I was about to say
that...*" no longer works.

The risk is, frontload too much, and the person you talk can't juggle all constraints in 
his or her short-term active memory. 

Especially when those constaints do not yet have a binding context (which would make it
easier to keep them cached) to the point you're trying to make.

That's one reason I love the written word, because then you **can** actually defer
constraints to later. You can make a point quicker, and store a body of constraints 
further down.

A side-benefit is that a reader doesn't have to listen through what you're assuming
the necessary constraints are, only reading the ones up for debate instead. This saves energy.

Regretfully, my experience shows there is a **inverse** correlation to a person's ability to
hold *N* not yet obviously related bits of data in their registers, and their inclinination to
point out a flaw in a concluding point before all constraint bits have been communicated.

The very people who urge me to: "*...get to the point*" are the people that make it difficult to
get to the point.

<div markdown="1" class="quote">
Agreed that there is an inverse correlation between someone's attention span, and
their interest in refuting your point.

I'll admit there are times when I could possibly optimize my wordiness, but I think
one great strategy for doing so is to defer constraints. Which per my point above, is only
possible when two people are constructively reaching a goal (i.e., there is some level of
mutual trust there is overlap in values).

Put differently; if neither party sets out to intentionally sabotage the opponents argument,
we are generally more amicable to permitting minor nitpicks because we're cooperative
in filling out the constraint space.
