title: "Sampling Error"
---

### Jaap
Ping?

### Michael
Pong?

### Jaap
You jumped online briefly this afternoon, but my ping came too
late. I can \[~only/\[~primarily/jokingly-mostly\]\] assume that you're immediate
offlineness was due to the fact that you saw that I was online and that you
were not at all interested in having another time sink of a Jaap monologue.

(...with \[~a/b\] being the syntax for: "I initially typed a, then
realized that it was too strong of a statement, and therefore replaced it with b
- yet leaving the a in (through said syntax) to indicate that I actually think about
what I type before I submit it.")

### Michael
Man, you know me well... :) :) 

I'm fighting a cold. Back in Cranbrook again.

### Jaap
Ah, right on. Once again disconnected from the reality we call the intertubes, and
thus forced to exercise your own brain due to lack of blog stimuli. Damn, that must
suck. Sorry to hear about your cold.

### Michael
Your sympathy is not misplaced. I'm kicking its ass...    :-)

### Jaap
Hahaha, nice. Hey, are you familiar with Dempster-Schafer Theory?

### Michael
Not off-hand. Wikipediaing. Interesting. Oddly, reminds me of Kalman filters.

### Jaap
It appears that Bayes Theorem (which I'm mostly motivated to read up on from OB/LW
reading) and the Kalman filter (which I'm motivated to read up on from Wiimote tracking)
both come up alongside Dempster-Schafer.

Of course, given how Bayes lies much closer to the root of the scientific method than
almost any other theorem, one could argue that Bayes is likely to show up in a lot of places.

### Michael
Oh, reading further.

### Jaap
I just thought it was kinda neat how two fairly distinct interests of mine overlapped
today.

### Michael
Looks kind of like meta-probability...

### Jaap
Hard to formalize meta-notions (call them computational sentiments) that have formed
in my brain after "grokking" the Kalman filter (in particular, the two step process
of calibration and reinforcement) appear to linger subconsciously in my readings
on rationality and AI. Maybe it's a deceptive bias from my surfing patterns, but
there appears to be an resurgence in converging of philosophy and math. Both in
philosophy of thought, and philosophy of the universe. I'm sort of glad to see that,
worried for a bit that a crystal-hippie interpretation of Godel would lead philosophers
to drift away from math.

### Michael
Did you catch the thing on Reddit the other day about "Why your friends have more
friends than you do..."?

### Jaap
No, searching... Got it.

### Michael
Jason and I were chatting about that article last weekend. Lots of things fall into
the same category. For example, the proposition that the best thing you can do in
traffic is to change lanes. Sample bias is *very* cool.

### Jaap
Hey, that's a *great* article.

### Michael
\:-)

### Jaap
Thanks for sharing.

### Michael
No problemo. Was thinking of you when we were discussing it this weekend.

### Jaap
Are you saying I'm biased? You'd better be... ;-)

### Michael
LOL. Was just about to say the same regarding my statement!

### Michael
Sample bias is one of these things that occupies a substantial part of my cognitive
load, I'd say. Not like I'm always thinking about it, but it really seems to come
up quite often.

### Jaap
When you say it's part of your cognitive load, you mean mostly regarding to identifying
it? Or to overcome it? And in other people, or in yourself, or in abstract?

### Michael
At the moment, mainly identifying it. Not sure it's possible, strictly, to overcome
it, although one certainly can learn to recognize sample bias. For now, perhaps
the best description of my involvement is that it makes me giggle every time I see
it.

### Jaap
A particular interesting form of sampling bias comes up a lot in the Doomsday argument.

### Michael
?

### Jaap
You are not familiar with the Doomsday argument? Oh boy, are you in for a treat.
Let me find a good reference... http://www.anthropic-principle.com/primer1.html
And the particular paper that explicitly talks about sampling bias (in this case,
"the self-indication-assumption"): http://www.anthropic-principle.com/preprints/olum/sia.pdf

### Michael
Reading...

### Jaap
Out of curiousity, is it sampling bias in particular that you are intruiged by,
or other forms of bias as well?

### Michael
Well, sampling bias seems to be at the bottom of many bias issues. What else do
you have in mind?

### Jaap
This paper lists some well known ones that I found fun to learn about: http://www.singinst.org/upload/cognitive-biases.pdf
Looking at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases, I'm not sure if
it's obvious to say that sampling bias is at the bottom of many other bias issues
(though I could probably be convinced that for most biases, one could define "sampling"
such that it could be seen as a sampling bias.) That could be a fun exercise. ....
Actually, I take my comment about the obviousness back.

### Michael
That's quite a list! I'd certainly be careful about saying that sampling bias was
at the bottom of all of those.

### Jaap
If we're talking about beliefs, and likelihood or "truthiness" of a belief is determined
through something Bayes-like, then by definition the only way to skew the result
is to skew the input. And since the input is a data-set, it's by definition a sampling
error. Unfortunately, for most topics of interest, the size of the input data set
required to obtain objective degrees of validity is so large, that sampling bias
is almost inevitable. The trick is to become efficient at avoiding the major errors.
Treating every error as a sampling error would be impractical. It's like saying
that every computer is a one-directional single tape Turing machine, which is true
- but my 8-core X86 is hella faster than the Turing machine... ;) You did totally
give me a new insight though... thank you for that! I must think about it more,
but the notion that bias is *always* a sampling issue if you dig deep enough really
appeals to me. It's like a Kalman filter - there's a sampling error, and you try
to overcome it.

### Michael
Yeah. I'm curious about it, actually.

### Jaap
From "I'm not sure if it's obvious to say that sampling bias is at the bottom of
many other bias issues." to the complete opposite in less than ten MSN messages.
Nice!

### Michael
\:-)

### Jaap
And only just now did I notice your comment: "I'd certainly be careful about saying
that sampling bias was at the bottom of all of those." LOL, did we just flip stances?

### Michael
I think I may be back on the sample bandwagon. The first bias I picked - the base
rate fallacy - is certainly a sampling issue. Jason and I had actually discussed
that one in terms of false-positive AIDS tests. :) :)

### Jaap
The space between "false positive AIDS tests" and ":):)" is too large for me to
infer what you were laughing about. The sheer amount of (in-)appropriate comments
I could make about AIDS make the whole thing rather intractable. ;)

### Michael
lol. "The sheer amount of jokes I could make about AIDS make the whole thing rather
intractable." -> There's sample bias in there somewhere, I'm sure.

### Jaap
"There's sample bias in there somewhere, I'm sure." -> Are you saying I have chlamydia?
Snap! Padamtam tjing!

### Michael
LOL

### Jaap
I think theoretical AI that operates on the fringe of both math and philosophy is
very much about finding statistical representations for cognitive biases.

### Michael
You know, though... For example: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denomination_effect
A lot of cognitive biases seem more related to psychology than to statistical anomalies.
It \[~would/will\] be really interesting to see what cognitive biases are exhibited
by an AI.

### Jaap
Going down the bias list some more I'm further led to believe that indeed it's all
about sampling in the end. Look at it this way... For any finite IO port (i.e.,
no omniscient gods), there exists an upper limit on universe size and resolution
beyond which the IO can't avoid sampling bias. ... Man, I think I just said something
really deep and awesome.... Though it'll probably be deep and awesome in the way
that waking up the next day with a hangover makes deep and meaningful things from
last night sound like moronicness. :)... I often feel there's a correlation between
how deep something sounds, and (provided it's not crystal-worshipping ambigious
trite) how utterly obivous it is once you see it.

### Michael
Hey, interesting point.

### Jaap
At any rate, imagine an AI that plays finite games of Pacman (finite meaning there's
only N levels so you can "beat" the game - and yes, the Monte Carlo AIXI prompted
this example...)

Then as long as you can increase the IO bandwidth (from only being
able to see one 'tile' forward and backward, to seeing the whole level and positions
of ghosts, to knowing all possible paths that ghosts could take, and simulating
those (sort of like Deep Blue plays chess, once you use "ghosts-don't-bang-their-heads-into-the-wall"
heuristics)), you can reach a point where there'll be no sampling bias anymore.

Note that not until Pacman can read the proverbial ghost's mind (e.g., have access
to the pseudo-random-number-generator that determines their paths) is all sampling
bias removed entirely. There's a sharp distinction between knowing what chess Grand
Master's are *likely* to do, and actually reading Kasparov's mind.

Further note that even in the presence of reading minds, Pacman has not yet become
God. Without the "game-is-beatable" guarantee, it seems possible for a particular ghost pattern
to inevitably corner Pacman. In the abscence of super-natural powers (i.e., that
transcend the original game, like walking through walls) it *will* be game over.
That's just a long way of saying that AI would still have to obey the laws of physics
(the actual ones, not our current descriptions thereof.)

### Michael
This feels related to my belief that even AI would be fundamentally throttled by
its interaction with the real world. For example, it doesn't have an inside track
on physical theory, really, so has to do experimentation just like anyone else (although
I think we can expect its theories to be more powerful).

### Jaap
Of course, I don't have to mention to you that when I say IO port, I'm obviously
referring to your eyes and ears and skin and so forth just as much as anything.

### Michael
\:-) Of course.

### Jaap
I point out that I don't have to point that out, to momentarily relish in the fact
that I actually happen to know somebody personally that I have that great privilege
with....

### Jaap
Hey, I'm gonna run to the cafetaria and get a snack, you gonna be here for a bit,
or leaving soon?

### Michael
I'll be here, I think.
