Most software in the iTunes App Store costs $0.99, $4.99, $7.99, or gratis - nearly always under ten dollars. Throw in one-click purchasing and you have a recipe for muscle memory impulse buying.

I recently bought a Novatel Mifi device -- which has a GPS unit -- and wondered if my iPod Touch could give me turn-by-turn car navigation. Not doing much research, I found TomTom's GPS software on iTunes, priced at $7.99 - or so I thought.

The answer to my curiosity; no, it doesn't seem like an iPod plus Mifi gets you in-car navigation. If anybody knows of a product or solution, let me know.

Oh well, nothing lost...

And then my iTunes receipt came in the mail, and I noticed the skewed decimal. That is to say, the actual price of TomTom's GPS software (at the time) was $79.99, not $7.99.

I suppose if the program did what I hoped, it may have been worth that still. But right now, I had spent 72 dollars more than planned, on an application I couldn't use.

Yes, I'm an idiot. My fault, no one else to blame.

Based on past experiences with buying and selling digital goods, I was skeptical that I'd have any chance of recovering the money. If it was possible at all, it'd probably require four emails (one of which [has to go to Steve Jobs](/2003/10/01/ceo-support/)), two phone-calls (with a combined time zone difference of at least nine hours), and a notarized letter (that can't be faxed).

Luckily, four million lines of C++ are a dog to compile, and my computer was plowing through about that many. Thus killing some time, I looked online for iTunes support, submitted a ticket, and was immediately asked to join a support chat.

Call me skeptical...

Welcome to iTunes Store Chat!
 
Hi Jaap, my name is Katrina.

It'll be just a moment while I review the comments you provided.
You'd like a refund for the TomTom GPS navigation app, correct?
</div>

That is correct, thank you. My order number is MGB7XVY790.

<div markdown="1" class="quote">
I'll certainly see what options are available. One moment, please, while I bring up that order.
</div>

Great, thank you!

<div markdown="1" class="quote">
Thank you for waiting, Jaap. The refund of $89.59 will be posted to the card that was charged in 3-5 business days.
</div>

Beautiful, thank you so much.

I imagine that iTUnes will automatically just remove the app from my iPod? Which would be okay, and complete this rather surprisingly smooth experience... (I'm a software developer, I expected this to be really painful, thanks again.)

<div markdown="1" class="quote">
Nope, we can't remove anything from your iPod or iPhone (or computer, for that matter).
</div>

Oh, ok. I'll delete it myself then... no worries. The app is not particularly useful for me right now anyway.

Kinda weird though (as a general observation), since it seems that this is an honor system. Oh well, I'm happy. Thanks, have a great day!

<div markdown="1" class="quote">
You too!

Thank you for chatting with us. Please click the blue "Close" button on the top left of the chat window to tell us how we did today.
</div>

Done.

Call me pleasantly surprised.
