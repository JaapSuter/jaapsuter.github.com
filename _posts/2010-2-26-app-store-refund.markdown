One of the programs in this collection of App Store programs is not like the other ones, can you find it?

Need a hint? The post's title should give it away - nearly all programs cost under ten dollars.

In fact, it doesn't take long to turn one-click purchasing of programs at $0.99, $4.99, gratis, and the occasional $7.99 into a muscle memory habit.

Wondering if my iPod Touch and Novatel Mifi could team up for some turn-by-turn car navigation, I bought Tom Tom GPS software in the time it takes to click a mouse button - not realizing that Tom Tom puts the decimal point at a slight offset.

> Yes, I'm an idiot. My fault, no one else to blame.

I recall a vague sense of dissonance when the app's download was measured in gigabytes rather than the usual kilo- or megabytes, but it wasn't until I got my receipt in the mail that I caught on. Adding insult to injury, moments thereafter I learned the Tom Tom iPod combination wouldn't be able to use the Mifi's GPS.

So I had spent 80 dollars more than planned, on an application I couldn't use.

> Yes, I'm an idiot. My fault, no one else to blame.

Based on past experiences with buying and selling digital goods, I was skeptical that I'd have any chance of recovering the money. If it was possible at all, it'd probably require four emails (one of which goes to Steve Jobs), two phone-calls (with a combined time zone difference of at least nine hours), and a notarized letter (that can't be faxed).

Luckily, four million lines of C++ are a dog to compile, and my computer was plowing through about that many. Thus killing some time, I looked online for iTunes support, submitted a ticket, and was immediately asked to join a support chat.

> Hi Jaap, my name is Katrina. It'll be just a moment while I review the comments you provided.
> You'd like a refund for the TomTom GPS navigation app, correct?

Jaap: That is correct, thank you. My order number is MGB7XVY790.

> Katrina: I'll certainly see what options are available. One moment, please, while I bring up that order.

Jaap: Great, thank you!

> Katrina: Thank you for waiting, Jaap. The refund of $89.59 will be posted to the card that was charged in 3-5 business days.

Jaap: Beautiful, thank you so much.

I imagine that iTUnes will automatically just remove the app from my iPOd? Which would be okay, and complete this rather surprisingly smooth experience... (I'm a software developer, I expected this to be really painful, thanks again.)

> Katrina: Nope, we can't remove anything from your iPod or iPhone (or computer, for that matter).

Jaap: Oh, ok. I'll delete it myself then... no worries. The app is not particularly useful for me right now anyway.

Kinda weird though (as a general observation), since it seems that this is an honour system. Oh well, I'm happy. Thanks, have a great day!

> Katrina: You too!

Done.

Call me pleasantly surprised.
