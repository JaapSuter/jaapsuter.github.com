This picture is from my last vacation in Les Deux Alpes, France. I went snowboarding for three weeks, and as you can see I'm upside down, in the middle of a front loop, a few meters above the snow, jumping about fifteen meters far. Anyway, I'm back in Holland again, and I'm currently picking up work again - a new project I'm very enthusiastic about. I started studying again, and had some apple juice with friends I haven't seen for a while. I'm sorry I've been unable to respond promptly to emails the past little while, but hopefully I've caught up by now.

See you later...
