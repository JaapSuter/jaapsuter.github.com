This is a picture taken from my last vacation in Les Deux Alpes, France. I went snowboarding for three weeks there and as you can see I'm upside down, in the middle of a frontloop, about 3 metres above the snow, jumping about 15 metres far. Anyway, I'm back in Holland again (sigh), and I'm currently picking up my work (a new project, which I'm very enthousiastic about), I started studying again, and drank lots of beer (and applejuice) with friends I haven't seen for a while. I'm sorry to those I couldn't reply for three weeks, but hopefully I replied everybodies mail by now. 

See you later...
