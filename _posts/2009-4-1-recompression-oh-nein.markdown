                                                         LONG SHOT:
        
> Dew shimmers on the long grass of Elphinstone center field. The sky is 
> blue, the sun is orange, and snow-capped mountains on the horizon 
> give birth to a technicolor rainbow. Calmly grazing underneath stands 
> a unicorn, blissfully unaware that yesteryears' `CHIRPING OF BIRDS` is 
> gradually overtaken by `SOUNDS OF CRACKERS`.

> Several people sit and stand around a table, apparently having

> Suddenly they all stop talking...

> The doors of the Cuckoo clock open, and a large platform on wheels
> emerges. Perched on top sits a lazy hippopotamus, wrapped in a fun
> fur coat, defiantly orange, arrogantly pink. Taking all the time
> in the world, the hippo opens its mouth. From deep inside, sounds
> emerge:
            
                            HIPPOPOTAMUS
