        INT. PORNGE HEADQUARTERS - NOON
        
                                                                FISH EYE ROOM:
                                                                
> Several people sit and stand around a table, apparently having

Suddenly they all stop talking...

The doors of the Cuckoo clock open, and a large platform on wheels
emerges. Perched on top sits a lazy hippopotamus, wrapped in a fun
fur coat, defiantly orange, arrogantly pink. Taking all the time
in the world, the hippo opens its mouth. From deep inside, sounds
emerge:
            
                                    HIPPOPOTAMUS
                                    
Cuuuuuuuuuuckooooooooooooooooo

Cuuuuuuuuuuckooooooooooooooooo

Cuuuuuuuuuuckooooooooooooooooo

Cuuuuuuuuuuckooooooooooooooooo

Cuuuuuuuuuuckooooooooooooooooo
                            
The hippopotamus sighs, and decides its done enough. It lies down as 
the platform rolls back into the clock and doors close.
            
                                                                CUT TO:

                               JAAP
        
Goddammit, it's fucking noon and that lazy
Cuckoo's cunt won't even give us twelve 
cucks and koos?
                    
Jaap sighs...
            
        MEDIUM SHOT:
        
                 
                            JAAP
                    
Whatever, let's stay focused. You were saying?
                    
                            STEPHANIE

I'm going to follow you around as my personal 
entertainment resource all fucking weekend.
                    
                            JAAP

Mmmmmmmm... Not bad, not bad at all...
                    
Yes, I definitely like where this is going.
                    
Jaap looks around
             
                            JAAP

And where is this going, anybody?
                    
                            FIRST NONDESCRIPT OFFICE DUDE
                            
                    Recompression, sir!
                    
                            JAAP

                    That's right, Recompression. Okay, eh..... what 
                    the fuck day is today?
                    
                            SECOND NONDESCRIPT OFFICE DUDE
                            
                    Wednesday, sir!
                    
                            JAAP
                            
                    Perfect, there might just be enough time left, but we
                    must act quickly...

                    How attached is our sales department to
                    this design?

                    And what about marketing, have they locked in 
                    already, or can we shuffle?
                    
            Jaap turns to Peter
            
                            JAAP

                    Peter, get Alistair from sales on the phone right now!
                    
            Jaap swivels 180 degrees in his chair
            
                            JAAP
                            
                    Taylor?

                            Taylor - ....

                                    Taylor?
                                    
            Swiveling back...
            
                            JAAP

                      Where the fuck is Taylor?
                      
            Standing up, angry, shouting:
            
                            JAAP

                      Goddammit, can one of you screw-heads find Taylor
                      and tell him of the ungodly firestorm of napalm I will 
                      rain on his ass if he's not here within ten minutes.
                      
                      Let him know that at 12:15 pm sharp I'm going to look
                      down at my growth region and I fully expect to see his
                      unshaven chin giving my left nutsack a deep soft tissue
                      massage, like his contract with the company stipulates.
                      
            Frustrated, Jaap sits down, shaking his head.
            
                            JAAP   

                      Fuck, what happened to work ethic and being a professional?
                      
                      Peter, any word from Alistair how much wiggle room 
                      the schedule has?
                      
            Jaap turns to woman standing in the back
            
                            JAAP

                      Hey Rebecca darling, can you swing by Home Depot and
                      pick up some extra vowels?

                      Thanks love, you're the best. Did I mention those jeans
                      really show what a great ass you have?
                      
            Jaap points to random office guy
            
                            JAAP

                       ...and ehm.... You there, with the ugly shirt...

                             What's your name again?
                        
                                    Right..... Henry - whatever.
                                    
                       Can you run down and grab a bag of consonants
                       from the basement?

                       Hurry up, we've got work to do.
                       
                                    It's shuffle time...
                       
            Jaap walks over to the whiteboard and grabs a pen.
            
                            JAAP

                        I like the concept people. Nothing wrong with 
                        having personal entertainment resources available
                        the entire fucking weekend, but with a minor tweak...
                        
            Jaap starts writing on the whiteboard, big bold letters:
            
                            JAAP

                        How about this folks?
                        
            Written on the whiteboard we see:
