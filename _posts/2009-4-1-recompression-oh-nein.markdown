        EXT. CAMP ELPHINSTONE - DAY
        
                                                         LONG SHOT:
        
> Dew shimmers on the long grass of Elphinstone center field. The sky is 
> blue, the sun is orange, and snow-capped mountains on the horizon 
> give birth to a technicolor rainbow. Calmly grazing underneath stands 
> a unicorn, blissfully unaware that yesteryears' `CHIRPING OF BIRDS` is 
> gradually overtaken by `SOUNDS OF CRACKERS`.

    CUT TO:

        INT. UNIDENTIFIED WALL - 11:59 AM
        
                                                          CLOSE UP:
        
> On the wall hangs an old antique Cuckoo clock. It's large; enormous in
> fact. It's one of the early Swiss prototypes, from before its inventor
> had settled on a species.

                                                        SLOW MOTION:
        
> With great effort, as if it's the last thing it'll ever do, the minute
> hand waves the eleventh hour goodbye, and makes its way to noon.

                                                      FISH EYE ROOM:

> Several people sit and stand around a table, apparently having
> some kind of meeting. People look stressed.

> Suddenly they all stop talking...

> The doors of the Cuckoo clock open, and a large platform on wheels
> emerges. Perched on top sits a lazy hippopotamus, wrapped in a fun
> fur coat, defiantly orange, arrogantly pink. Taking all the time
> in the world, the hippo opens its mouth. From deep inside, sounds
> emerge:
            
                            HIPPOPOTAMUS
                              
>>> *Cuuuuuuuuuuckooooooooooooooooo*

>>> *Cuuuuuuuuuuckooooooooooooooooo*

>>> *Cuuuuuuuuuuckooooooooooooooooo*
                            
> The hippopotamus sighs, and decides its done enough. It lies down as 
> the platform rolls back into the clock and doors close.
