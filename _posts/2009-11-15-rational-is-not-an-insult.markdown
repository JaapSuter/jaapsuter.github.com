title: "Rational Is Not An Insult"

# {{ page.title }}


### Jaap
In regards to "rational" getting a bad-rep, see this article for an **anecdotal**
data point:

 * [Why Rational Thinking Is Bad](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/srinivasan-pillay/why-rational-thinking-is_b_183082.html)

My view; the title carries the connotation that there are problems with rational
thinking, and then the body of the article merely states how human beings are not
always perfectly rational.

The latter observation is obvious to me, and studying how people wield their rational
capacity (e.g., heuristics and biases) seems like a worthwhile effort. But I don't
see how the article's title follows from that.

We're not perfectly skilled at rescueing starving children either, but few people would
title an article:

 * Why Saving Lives Of Starving Children Is Bad

But contrary to the lives of children, the debate on reason has't settled yet. We shouldn't let failures of 
our rational faculty justify anything, certainly not a claim that rationality itself is bad. So far, it's **the** 
mechanism to reason about reality, with unsurpassed effectiveness.

### Michael
And, in fact, I might argue that most things in day-to-day life can be understood
rationally.

For example, with something like love, I don't think you have to boil it down to
an objective measure. But I think you can postulate a human emotion called love, and
strive to understand it using rationality.

You can even anticipate certain things about it.

Most of the "irrational" things about love are perfectly predictable, and that,
to me, means that they should be entirely comprehensible to a rational being, even
if they cannot be derived from a set of axioms which does not include love itself.

### Jaap

I don't think many people argue that you'd have to boil it down to an objective measure. Even
those who might probably don't have it at the top of their priority list.

**However**, a great many people that I respect will argue that when a person's quality of
life suffers because of his or her inability to love or be loved to the degree that
he or she desires, that **the** most effective mechanism for solving this problem,
is through sound application of rational principles.

Certainly more effective than waiting until some newspaper's astrology prediction
aligns with the sacred crystals I hide under my pillow.

### Michael
Totally, exactly what I'm thinking. The thing is, rational principles can be applied to understand
a huge range of things.

And to solve a wide variety of problems.

The astrology example is good, actually, because astrology itself is something which,
offhand at least, seems to be completely irrational.

**However**, that people follow astrology is not at all irrational.

Because if you know one or two things about people, I think you could foresee that
they would follow something like that.

### Jaap
But surely **we shouldn't confuse the social phenomenon with the indivual's beliefs.**

They're related somehow, but one is not a justification for the other.

A lot of people believe *X*. There's an evolutionary principle that plausibly 
explains the desire to belief *X*. Therefore it is okay to belief *X*...?

That kind of reasoning is used to justify so many apalling behavior.

### Michael
See, this is why I like you.

I think we can understand the desire to believe *X*, but it doesn't imply that *X* is
a good way to understand things.

Doesn't mean it's okay to do it that way, but we can certainly foresee that someone
might.

### Jaap
Exactly, myself included; I'm certainly not immune to it.

But I make a modest effort to recognize a general principle, and I'm willing to admit
past mistakes, and then change my future behaviour, or submit to my evolutionary
weakness in all honesty (like the fact that I just drank a sugar-loaded can of soda-pop).
