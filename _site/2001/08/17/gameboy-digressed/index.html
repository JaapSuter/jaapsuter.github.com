<p>Here are some shots of my very first Gameboy Advance (GBA) programming adventure. The past few weeks I&#8217;ve been on vacation in France, and every afternoon I would do some GBA programming on my laptop. Lying by the side of the pool, programming, with a view on the mountains. Very nice!</p>

<p>Anyway, I started working on a project called Socrates. It&#8217;s an object oriented library for the GBA written completely in C. Object Orientation in C? Yes, it&#8217;s possible.</p>

<p>The library is written for MODE-4 graphics. This is the only full-screen video mode that supports double buffering. The only drawback is that it&#8217;s a 8 bits palettized mode, and that you can only plot two pixels at a time. So if you have to write one pixel, you must read-modify-write. However, this proved to be quite a funny obstacle in my polygon drawing routines.</p>

<p>About the images, from top to bottom, left to right.</p>

<li>Crossfading, speeding this up was tricky. It&#8217;s still not at full speed. I probably gonna need some ASM for this.</li>

<li>Shows a couple of flatshaded cubes, with frustum clipping as well.</li>

<li>A couple of flatshaded cubes without frustum clipping.</li>

<li>Title-screen.</li>

<li>Some kind of texturemapping, plasma-ish effect.</li>

<li>Two texturemapped cubes with frustum clipping.</li>

<li>More&#8230;</li>

<li>&#8230;Of</li>

<li>The&#8230;</li>

<li>Same.</li>
</ol>

<p>The 3D engine is completely fixed point and I&#8217;m quite happy with the speed raw C delivers. Soon I&#8217;ll add some inline ASM to speed thing up, but for now I&#8217;m focusing on getting some more functionality done. Though, Quake like 6DOF is not gonna happen on GBA. Unless somebody proves me wrong.</p>

<p>Currently I&#8217;m working on a voxel landscape on GBA but I&#8217;m rather pessimistic on performance issues. I suppose I&#8217;ll have to start doing some sprite, tile, background scrolling stuff soon.</p>

<p>Overall, I love it. Working for a machine with low performance but a complete set of fixed functionality. No more compatibility issues. Jippie.</p>

<p>By the way, it works on the real thing as well. Thanks DarkFader.</p>
